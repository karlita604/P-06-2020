* Python uses whitespace instead of brackets and so it is much easier to understand and learn.
* Built in libraries are extremely helpful but there are also user built libraries which are open sourced that can help you complete basically any project you can think of.

### What to use for your projects?
* **Text Editors** are designed to work with a variety of file types (.txt, .py, etc) and can also be customized with plugins and add-ons
* Sublime Text and Atom (just examples) that without plugins would sacrifice some pythom functionality. 
* **FULL IDE <3** --> Pycharm and Spyder
